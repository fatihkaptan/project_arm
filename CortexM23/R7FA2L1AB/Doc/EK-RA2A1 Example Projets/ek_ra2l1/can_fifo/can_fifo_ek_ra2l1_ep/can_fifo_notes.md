# Introduction #

This project demonstrates transmit and receive FIFO operations in the context of CAN (Controller Area Network) on Renesas RA MCUs
using 2 RA boards. On Board 1 enter any key on RTT viewer to send a remote frame to Board 2 to request data.
When receiving a remote frame, Board 2 will send four messages back-to-back to Board 1. Board 1 receives data
and displays it on the RTT viewer. On successful comparison of data, Board 1 will transmit a data frame to 
Board 2 as received acknowledgment. Error messages and information will be printed on the J-link RTT Viewer.

**Note**: In this example project, the same code runs on both boards.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##

For clock configuration on RA2 devices only support CANMCLK (MOSC/XTAL) for the CAN clock source. If MOSC is not used as the main clock source it will not be started automatically. The user application must start the main-clock oscillator (XTAL) at run-time using the CGC Interface if it has not already started.

## API Usage ##

The table below lists the CAN API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|R_CAN_Open| This API is used to initialize CAN module. |
|R_CAN_Write| This API is used to Write data to the CAN channel. |
|R_CAN_Close| This API is used to un-initialize CAN module. |
|R_CGC_Open (Only on RA2 devices)| This API is used to initialize CGC module. |
|R_CGC_ClockStart (Only on RA2 devices)| This API is used to start the main-clock oscillator. |
|R_CGC_Close (Only on RA2 devices)| This API is used to un-initialize CGC module. |

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of [FSP User Manual](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html)) in both boards. After running the EP, open the RTT viewer to view status or check error messages.

Below images showcase the output on J-Link RTT Viewer :

## Special Topics ##
Transmit and Receive FIFOs (First In, First Out) are important components that contribute to the efficient and reliable communication between nodes in a CAN network.
* Transmit FIFOs in CAN controllers allow the buffering of outgoing messages.
* Receive FIFOs store incoming messages until the microcontroller is ready to process them.

When FIFO Support is enabled, mailboxes 24-27 form a 4-stage transmit FIFO and mailboxes 28-31 form a 4-stage receive FIFO.
The receive FIFO supports two independent ID/mask settings for acceptance filtering.
