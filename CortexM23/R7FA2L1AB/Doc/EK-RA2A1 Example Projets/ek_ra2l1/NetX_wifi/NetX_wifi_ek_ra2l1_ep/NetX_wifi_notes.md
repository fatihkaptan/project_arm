# Introduction #

The example code accompanying this file shows the operation of a NetX Duo Wifi module using RA MCU Azure RTOS NetX Duo Network Drivers. 
In this example code, A NetX Duo IP instance is created upon call to NetX Duo Network Drivers APIs ,NetX Duo Wifi utilizes the WiFi Onchip Silex module for Wifi Access point connectivity,IP address assignment and Ping to IP address entered by the user. 
Upon successful initialization of WiFi Onchip Silex module,user is asked to select the SSID to connect in auto scan mode or to Enter the desired SSID for wifi connection in Manual mode.Once Entered the SSID name the user is asked for security to be entered(Open,WPA or WPA2) as menu option ,after this the password(according to security) is to be entered by the user to connect to particular SSID.
The Azure NetX Duo initializes the packet pool creation with definite packet payload size,where the network packets are utilized in data transfer from client and server via TCP.
The connection to TCP server(Details of requirements and steps to connect are mentioned in below sections) is done in client mode using NetX APIs for creation of TCP socket,binding of the specified port and connecting to the entered address of running TCP server by the user.Upon successful connection with TCP server data packets are sent to the server and received from the server by the application ,On board LED state is changed(on or off) as per the message received from the connected TCP server.

The status messages, like MCU IP address,Ping status,TCP connection status,message from the  TCP server and errors(if any) are displayed on the JlinkRTTViewer.

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open the RTT viewer to see the output.
Before running the example project, refer to the below steps for hardware connections :
* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
* Connect an Silex Module to the UART PMOD on RA board.
* TCP Server must be running at valid IP address on same network on which Application is running.
*Note*: If TCP server not started before MCU tries to connect, then application would fail.

* Send message to server on Connection and wait for server message:      
![server_status_message.JPG](images/server_status_message.JPG "Sending and Receive Server Message")
* The message from TCP Server as "on" or "off" is sent and is displayed in RTT viewer upon successful reception of valid message:  
(Here either "on" or "off" is considered as a valid message from TCP server as these perform same action on User LED.Refer below images for Sokit tool images.)

## Steps for TCP server creation and connection ##

* Download and Run Sokit application.(Download link attached in **[Software](#Software)** Requirements section of this file.).The application interface looks like below image.
![sokit_interface.JPG](images/sokit_interface.JPG "Sokit Interface")

* The IP address of System on which sokit is running must be entered under **TCP Addr** section, so that it runs TCP Server over this entered IP of System on network. Suggestion is to
TCP server in PC should listen at a port number greater than 10000.Enter IP address under **TCP Addr** section and free port under **Port** of sokit application.After Entering the details click on **TCP Listen** button in application as shown in below image.    

![sokit_init.JPG](images/sokit_init.JPG "Sokit Initialization")

* After successful connection to the TCP server The sokit application shows IP address and port number of the client under **Connections** section in sokit application with "Hello" message from client,as shown in Image below.  
![sokit_client_conn.JPG](images/sokit_client_conn.JPG "Sokit Client Connection")

* After successful establishment of connection between TCP Client application(which is EP running in client mode) and TCP server,message transfer can be made from server to client Select the Client in Connections window ,Enter 'on' or 'off' in Buffer section(shown as Buf1,Buf2,Buf3 in image) of Sokit,as shown in below image.
![sokit_on_off_msg.JPG](images/sokit_on_off_msg.JPG "Sokit Client Connection")

* For the Application Other message than "on" or "off" is considered Invalid(Reception of Message is shown in RTT viewer).Acknowledgement from connected client is sent to server on successful reception of "on" or "off" message.
On sending "on",user LED turns ON and on sending "off" User LED is turned OFF.No action is performed on reception of any other message string.

## Special Topics ##
### Running tips ###
* Presuming all necessary hardware connections done, a user should connect their PC or laptop connected to the same WiFi router AP. 
* On PC/laptop, user neeeds to create TCP server and start listening at port which is free.
* TCP server on PC can be created using freely available tool sokit and using **[ Steps for TCP server creation and connection](# Steps for TCP server creation and connection)**.
* TCP server must be running before the application tries to connect otherwise tcp connection functionality will fail on running application. 
* Values Sent from connected TCP server other than 'on' or 'off' will have no effect on LED.
* If EP is not working in terms of network connection/ip, please re-check RA configuration property for pins and Ensure that the TCP server is running before application starts.
