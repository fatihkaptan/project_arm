        operations selected by the user in configurator properties. Events can be selected viz.,Compare Match, Compare Mismatch, 
        Addition Overflow, Subtraction Underflow and compares with the reference data. Upon Success/Failure of operation, the 
        result will be displayed on RTT viewer.LED will turn ON only if the selected event operation is success.
