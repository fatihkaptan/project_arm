1. Project Overview:
    This Example Project demonstrates SCI_I2C Master operation through loop-back with IIC Slave driver.
    6 bytes of data will be transmitted and received continuously on successful initialization. 
    The transmitted data is compared with the received data. If the data matches, on-board LED
    starts blinking. On a data mismatch, LED stays ON.
    Failure messages and status is displayed on RTTViewer.

    LED output Status on Master TX and RX data mismatch(failure) and data match(success)
    a) Failure  - Led is set as ON
    b) Success  - Led blinks for each transaction

2. Hardware Settings:
    Two jumper wires are required to establish loop back connection along IIC lines within the board with pins as mentioned below.

Note:
* For the functioning of SCI_I2C Master and IIC Slave on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3/EK-RA6M3G,FPB-RA6E1,FPB-RA4E1, external pull up
  resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7k ohms are required to be connected on I2C(SDA/SCL) lines.
